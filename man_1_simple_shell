.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.RI [ command ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a simple UNIX command line interpreter that reads commands from
standard input or from a file and executes them.
.PP
The shell displays a prompt and waits for the user to type a command.
A command line always ends with a new line. The prompt is displayed
again each time a command has been executed.
.PP
The shell supports command lines with arguments and searches for
commands in the directories specified by the PATH environment variable.
.SH OPTIONS
The shell does not accept any command-line options. If arguments are
provided, they are ignored.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.B simple_shell
returns the exit status of the last command executed, or 1 if an error
occurred.
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The shell has the following built-in commands:
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell. The exit status is 0 unless an error occurred.
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables.
.SH PATH HANDLING
The shell searches for commands in the directories listed in the
.B PATH
environment variable, in the order they appear.
.PP
When a command is entered:
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
If the command contains a slash
.B (/),
it is treated as a pathname and is executed directly.
.IP \(bu 3
If the command does not contain a slash, the shell searches each
directory in
.B PATH
until an executable file with the given name is found.
.IP \(bu 3
If the command is not found, an error message is printed and no
child process is created.
.RE
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
Commands are executed as follows:
.RS
.IP 1. 3
The command line is parsed into a command name and arguments.
.IP 2. 3
If the command is a built-in, it is executed directly.
.IP 3. 3
Otherwise, the shell searches for the command in the PATH.
.IP 4. 3
If found, a child process is created using
.BR fork (2)
and the command is executed using
.BR execve (2).
.IP 5. 3
The parent process waits for the child to complete using
.BR wait (2).
.RE
