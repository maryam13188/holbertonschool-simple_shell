.TH HSH 1 "December 2025" "Simple Shell 1.0"
.SH NAME
hsh \- a simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.RI [file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command interpreter written in C.
It reads commands from standard input or from a file and executes
them using system calls.
.PP
In interactive mode, the shell displays a prompt and waits for
user input. In non-interactive mode, commands are read from
standard input without displaying a prompt.
.PP
This project demonstrates fundamental UNIX shell concepts such as
process creation, command execution, and PATH resolution.
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell.
.TP
.B env
Display the current environment variables.
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
Commands are executed by creating a child process using
.B fork
and running the command with
.B execve.
The parent process waits for the child process to terminate.
.SH PATH RESOLUTION
If a command does not contain a '/', the shell searches for it
in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
If the command cannot be found, an error message is printed.
.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
Interactive mode:
$ ./hsh
($) ls
($) env
($) exit

Non-interactive mode:
$ echo "ls" | ./hsh
$ ./hsh script.sh
.fi

The shell returns the exit status of the last executed command.
