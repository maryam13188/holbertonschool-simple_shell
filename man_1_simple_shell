.TH HSH 1 "December 2025" "Simple Shell 1.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
hsh \- a simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.RI [ file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a minimal UNIX command interpreter written in C. It reads commands
from standard input or from a file and executes them using system calls.

.PP
When executed in interactive mode, the shell displays a prompt and
waits for user input. In non-interactive mode, commands are read from
standard input without displaying a prompt.

.PP
This project is an educational implementation designed to demonstrate
core UNIX shell concepts such as process creation, command execution,
environment handling, and PATH resolution.
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell and return the status of the last executed command.
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables to standard output.
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
External commands are executed by creating a child process using
.BR fork (2)
and running the command with
.BR execve (2).
The parent process waits for the child process to terminate using
.BR wait (2).
.SH PATH RESOLUTION
If a command does not contain a slash (\fB/\fP), the shell searches for
the executable in the directories listed in the
.B PATH
environment variable.

.PP
If the command cannot be found, an error message is printed and the
shell continues execution.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The shell returns the exit status of the last executed command. If an
error occurs, a non-zero status is returned.
.SH EXIT CODES
.TP
.B 0
Successful execution.
.TP
.B 1
General error.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell searches for
executable commands.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I shell.h
Header file containing structure definitions and function prototypes.
.TP
.I main.c
Program entry point and main shell loop.
.TP
.I shell.c
Core shell logic including command execution and PATH handling.
.TP
.I helper_functions.c
Utility functions for input parsing and helper routines.
.TP
.I man_1_simple_shell
Manual page for the
.B hsh
shell.
.SH EXAMPLES
Interactive mode:
.PP
.nf
$ ./hsh
($) ls
($) env
($) exit
.fi

Non-interactive mode:
.PP
.nf
$ echo "ls" | ./hsh
$ ./hsh script.sh
.fi
.SH LIMITATIONS
This shell implementation supports basic command execution and a
limited set of built-in commands. Advanced features such as job
control, command history, pipes, and signal handling are not
implemented.
