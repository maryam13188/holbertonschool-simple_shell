# C-Simple Shell (hsh)

---

## 📌 Description
**Simple Shell** is a UNIX command line interpreter developed in C as part of
the Holberton School curriculum.  
The project focuses on understanding how a shell works internally by
recreating core features of the standard UNIX shell (`/bin/sh`).

The shell reads user input, parses commands, and executes programs using
system calls.

## Learning Objectives
* Look for the right source of information online
* How to create, open, close, read and write files
* What are file descriptors
* What are the 3 standard file descriptors, what are their purpose and what are their POSIX names
* How to use the I/O system calls open, close, read and write
* What are and how to use the flags `O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY`, `O_RDWR`
* What are file permissions, and how to set them when creating a file with the open system call
* What is a system call
* What is the difference between a function and a system call
---
## Requirements
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etc… is forbidden
* Allowed syscalls: read, write, open, close
* You are allowed to use `_putchar`
* You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
* In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you * do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
Tip: always prefer using symbolic constants (POSIX) vs numbers when it makes sense. For instance read(STDIN_FILENO, ... vs read(0, ...

## 🧠 Background
A shell acts as an interface between the user and the operating system.
It allows users to execute commands, manage processes, and interact
with the system efficiently.

This project is inspired by the original UNIX shell created by **Ken Thompson**.

---

## ✨ Features
✔ Interactive mode  
✔ Non-interactive mode  
✔ Command execution with arguments  
✔ PATH environment variable handling  
✔ Built-in command:
- `exit` — exits the shell  
✔ Error handling similar to `/bin/sh`  
✔ No memory leaks  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Displays a prompt in interactive mode
2. Reads input using `getline`
3. Parses commands and arguments
4. Creates a child process with `fork`
5. Executes commands using `execve`
6. Parent process waits for the child to finish

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 🔧 Compilation
```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```
---

### 📄Interactive Mode
```
- **$ ./hsh**
- **($) /bin/ls**
- **hsh main.c shell.c**
- **($) exit**
### 📄 Non-Interactive Mode
- **$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh**
- **hsh main.c shell.c**
```
---

### ❌ Error Handling

Error messages are printed in a format similar to /bin/sh.
The program name displayed matches argv[0].

Example:
```bash
$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
```
---

### 🧩 Allowed Functions

Only approved system calls and functions are used, such as:
`fork, execve, wait, getline, malloc, free, access, stat,
`perror, write, and read.

## Project Tasks (Development Stages)

### 0. Betty would be proud
Write clean, readable, and well-structured code that passes all Betty
coding style checks.

---

### 1. Simple shell 0.1
